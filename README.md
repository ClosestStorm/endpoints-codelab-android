Codelab: Using Google Cloud Endpoints for "Todo.txt" Android App
==========================

This codelab is an introduction to [Google Cloud Endpoints](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/endpoints), the technology that enables the publication of RESTful APIs which can easily be consumed by Android applications. We will start from an existing mobile Android application and connect it to a brand new backend powered by Cloud Endpoints. All development will be done with the Android Studio IDE.
